The World Health \\nOrganization (WHO) defines health as a state of complete physical, mental, \\nand social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity. \\nMental health is a state of well-being in which an individual realizes their own \\nabilities, copes with the normal stresses of life, works productively, and \\ncontributes to their community. The promotion, protection, and restoration of \\nmental health is a vital concern of individuals, nurses, communities, and \\nsocieties throughout the world.\\n1 \\nAccording to the American Psychiatric Association, mental illness is a health \\ncondition involving changes in emotion, thinking, or behavior (or a \\ncombination of these) associated with emotional distress and problems \\nfunctioning in social, work, or family activities.\\n2\\n Mental illness is common in \\nthe United States. Nearly one in five (19 percent) of adults experience some \\nform of mental illness, one in twelve (8.5 percent) have a substance use \\ndisorder, and one in 24 (4 percent) have a serious mental illness.\\n3 \\nPoor mental health increases the risk of chronic physical illnesses, such as \\nheart disease, cancer, and strokes, and can lead to thoughts and intentions of \\nsuicide.

This definition includes \\nthree components referred to as dysfunction, distress, and deviance.\\n15 \\nDysfunction includes disturbances in a person’s thinking, emotional \\nregulation, or behavior that reflects significant dysfunction in psychological, \\nbiological, or developmental processes underlying mental functioning. In \\nother words, dysfunction refers to a breakdown in cognition, emotion, and/or \\nbehavior. For instance, an individual experiencing a delusion that they are an \\nomnipotent deity has a breakdown in cognition because their thought \\nprocesses are not consistent with reality. An individual who is unable to \\nexperience pleasure has a breakdown in emotion, and an individual who is \\nunable to leave home and attend work due to fear of having a panic attack is \\nexhibiting a breakdown in behavior.\\n16 \\nDistress refers to psychological and/or physical pain. Simply put, distress \\nrefers to suffering. For example, the loss of a loved one causes anyone to \\nexperience emotional pain, distress, and a temporary impairment in \\nfunctioning. Impairment refers to a limited ability to engage in activities of \\ndaily living (i.e., they cannot maintain personal hygiene, prepare meals, or pay \\nbills) or participate in social events, work, or school. Impairment can also \\ninterfere with the ability to perform important life roles such as a caregiver, \\nparent, or student.\\n17 \\nDeviance refers to behavior that violates social norms or cultural expectations \\nbecause one’s culture determines what is “normal.” When a person is \\ndescribed as “deviant,” it means they are not following the stated and \\nunstated rules of their society (referred to as social norms).\\n18 \\nNurses complete and document initial and ongoing assessments of \\ndysfunction, distress, and behavior associated with an individual’s diagnosed \\nmental health disorder.

Trauma results from an event, series of \\nevents, or set of circumstances that are experienced by an individual as \\nphysically or emotionally harmful and can have lasting adverse effects on the \\nindividual’s functioning and physical, social, emotional, or spiritual well-being. \\nEvents may be human-made, such as war, terrorism, sexual abuse, violence, \\nor medical trauma, or they can be the products of nature (e.g., flooding, \\nhurricanes, and tornadoes). Nurses must keep in mind to not interject their \\nown experiences or perspectives because something minor to them may be \\nmajor to the client. \\nIt’s not just the event itself that determines if it is traumatic, but the \\nindividual’s experience of the event. Two people may be exposed to the same \\nevent or series of events but experience and interpret these events in vastly \\ndifferent ways. Various biopsychosocial and cultural factors influence an \\nindividual’s immediate response and long-term reactions to trauma. For most \\nindividuals, regardless of the severity of the trauma, the effects of trauma are \\nmet with resilience, defined as the ability to rise above circumstances or \\nmeet challenges with fortitude. Resilience includes the process of using \\navailable resources to negotiate hardship and/or the consequences of adverse \\nevents.\\n1 \\nTrauma can affect people of any culture, age, gender, or sexual orientation. \\nIndividuals may also experience trauma even if the event didn’t happen to \\nthem. A traumatic experience can be a single event, a series of events, or \\nadverse childhood experiences (ACEs).

For example, a client \\nexperiencing bipolar disorder may exhibit a lack of financial and sexual \\nboundaries.

Another example of boundary issues is an \\nindividual with a depressive disorder who is treated poorly by their partner \\nbut does not leave or assert boundaries because they don’t feel that they \\ndeserve to be treated any better. \\nNurses must establish professional boundaries with all clients while also \\nmaintaining a respectful and caring relationship.

A Nurses Guide to Professional Boundaries by the \\nNational Council of State Boards of Nursing (NCSBN) states that it is the \\nnurse’s responsibility to use clinical judgment to determine and maintain \\nprofessional boundaries. Nurses should limit self-disclosure of personal \\ninformation and avoid situations where they have a personal or business \\nrelationship with a client.

Simultaneously, nurses introduce \\nthemselves and begin to obtain essential information about clients as \\nindividuals with unique needs, values, beliefs, and priorities. During this brief \\nphase, trust is established, and rapport begins to develop between the client \\nand the nurse. Nurses ensure privacy when talking with the client and \\nproviding care and respect the client’s values, beliefs, and personal \\nboundaries. \\nA common framework used for introductions during patient care is AIDET, a \\nmnemonic for Acknowledge, Introduce, Duration, Explanation, and Thank \\nYou. \\n• Acknowledge: Greet the patient by the name documented in their \\nmedical record. Make eye contact, smile, and acknowledge any family or \\nfriends in the room. Ask the patient their preferred way of being \\naddressed (for example, “Mr. Doe,” “Jonathon,” or “Johnny”) and their \\npreferred pronouns (e.g., he/him, she/her, or they/them). \\n• Introduce: Introduce yourself by your name and role. For example, “I’m \\nJohn Doe, and I am a nursing student working with your nurse to take \\ncare of you today.” \\n• Duration: Estimate a timeline for how long it will take to complete the \\ntask you are doing. For example, “I am here to perform an admission \\nassessment. This should take about 15 minutes.” \\n• Explanation: Explain step by step what to expect next and answer \\nquestions. For example, “I will be putting this blood pressure cuff on your \\narm and inflating it. It will feel as if it is squeezing your arm for a few \\nmoments.” \\n• Thank You: At the end of the encounter, thank the patient and ask if \\nanything is needed before you leave. In an acute or long-term care \\nsetting, ensure the call light is within reach and the patient knows how to \\nuse it.

Here is the call light (Place within reach). Press the red \\nbutton if you would like to call the nurse.” \\nWORKING PHASE \\nThe majority of a nurse’s time with a client is in the working phase. During \\nthis phase, nurses use active listening and begin by asking the reason the \\nclient is seeking care to determine what is important to them. They use \\nassessment findings to develop a nursing plan of care and plan patient \\neducation. If a care plan has already been established on admission, nurses \\nuse this time to implement interventions targeted to meet short-term \\noutcomes and long-term goals. During the working phase, clients begin to \\naccept nurses as health educators, counselors, and care providers. Nurses use \\ntherapeutic communication techniques to facilitate clients’ awareness of their \\nthoughts and feelings and mutually develop goals and an individualized plan \\nof care. Nurses provide reflective and nonjudgmental feedback to clients to \\nhelp them clarify their thoughts, goals, and coping strategies.\\n5\\n Therapeutic \\ncommunication techniques used during this phase, including motivational \\ninterviewing, are discussed later in this chapter. \\nTERMINATION PHASE \\nThe final phase of a nurse-client relationship is the termination phase. This \\nphase typically occurs at the end of a shift or on discharge from care. If the \\nprevious working phase has been successful, the client’s needs have been \\nsuccessfully met by collaboration among the client, nurses, and \\ninterprofessional health care team members. The nurse should be aware the \\nclient may try to return to the working phase to avoid termination of the \\nrelationship. During the termination phase, the nurse can encourage the \\nclient to reflect on progress they have made and review post-discharge goals. \\n5. Hagerty, T.

Passive listening occurs when we \\nare not interested in listening to the other person, and we assume we \\nunderstand what the person is communicating correctly without verifying \\ntheir message. During active listening, we communicate both verbally and \\nnonverbally that we are interested in what the other person is saying while \\nalso actively verifying our understanding with them.

Nurses use professional touch when \\nassessing, expressing concern, or comforting patients. For example, simply \\nholding a patient’s hand during a painful procedure can effectively provide \\ncomfort. \\nFor individuals with a history of trauma, touch can be negatively perceived, so \\nit is important to ask permission before touching. Inform the person before \\nengaging in medical procedures requiring touch such as, “I need to hold \\ndown your arm so I can draw blood.” \\nNurses should avoid using touch with individuals who are becoming agitated \\nor experiencing a manic or psychotic episode because it can cause escalation. \\nIt is also helpful to maintain a larger interpersonal distance when interacting \\nwith an individual who is experiencing paranoia or psychosis. \\nTherapeutic Communication Techniques \\nThere are a variety of therapeutic techniques that nurses use to engage \\nclients in verbalizing emotions, establishing goals, and discussing coping \\nstrategies.

It is a technique that explores a client’s motivation, confidence, \\nand roadblocks to change.

Use reflective listening to convey acceptance and a \\nnonjudgmental attitude.

Help clients become aware of the gap between \\ntheir current behaviors and their values and goals.

High levels of stress can cause \\nsymptoms like headaches, back pain, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Chronic \\nstress contributes to the development of chronic illnesses, as well as acute \\nphysical illnesses due to decreased effectiveness of the immune system. It is \\nimportant for nurses to recognize signs and symptoms of stress in themselves \\nand others, as well as encourage effective stress management strategies. We \\nwill begin this section by reviewing the stress response and signs and \\nsymptoms of stress and then discuss stress management techniques. \\nStress Response \\nStressors are any internal or external event, force, or condition that results in \\nphysical or emotional stress.\\n1\\n The body’s sympathetic nervous system (SNS) \\nresponds to actual or perceived stressors with the “fight, flight, or freeze” \\nstress response. Several reactions occur during the stress response that help \\nthe individual to achieve the purpose of either fighting or running. The \\nrespiratory, cardiovascular, and musculoskeletal systems are activated to \\nbreathe rapidly, stimulate the heart to pump more blood, dilate the blood \\nvessels, and increase blood pressure to deliver more oxygenated blood to the \\nmuscles. The liver creates more glucose for energy for the muscles to use to \\nfight or run. Pupils dilate to see the threat (or the escape route) more clearly. \\nSweating prevents the body from overheating from excess muscle \\ncontraction. Because the digestive system is not needed during this time of \\nthreat, the body shunts oxygen-rich blood to the skeletal muscles. To \\ncoordinate all these targeted responses, hormones, including epinephrine, \\nnorepinephrine, and glucocorticoids (including cortisol, often referred to as \\nthe “stress hormone”), are released by the endocrine system via the \\nhypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) and dispersed to the many SNS \\nneuroreceptors on target organs simultaneously.\\n2\\n After the response to the \\n1.

Exhale completely \\nand wait three seconds, and then inhale as slowly as possible. Slowly stretch \\nyour arms and legs and push your feet against the floor. The next step is to \\nfocus on the world around you. Notice where you are and what you are doing. \\nUse your five senses. What are five things you can see? What are four things \\nyou can hear? What can you smell? Tap your leg or squeeze your thumb and \\ncount to ten. Touch your knees or another object within reach. What does it \\nfeel like? Grounding helps us engage in life, refocus on the present moment, \\nand realign with our values.\\n27 \\nUnhooking \\nAt times we may have unwanted, intrusive, negative thoughts that negatively \\naffect us. “Unhooking” is a tool to manage and decrease the impact of these \\nunwanted thoughts. First, NOTICE that a thought or feeling has hooked you, \\nand then NAME it. Naming it begins by silently saying, “Here is a thought,” or \\n“Here is a feeling.” By adding “I notice,” it unhooks us even more. For example, \\n“I notice there is a knot in my stomach.” The next step is to REFOCUS on what \\nyou are doing, fully engage in that activity, and pay full attention to whoever is \\nwith you and whatever you are doing. For example, if you are having dinner \\nwith family and notice feelings of anger, note “I am having feelings of anger,” \\nbut choose to refocus and engage with family.\\n28 \\n27.

Even when facing difficult situations, \\nwe can still make the conscious choice to act in line with our values. The more \\nwe focus on our own actions, the more we can influence our immediate world \\nand the people and situations we encounter every day. We must continually \\nask ourselves, “Are my actions moving me toward or away from my values?” \\nRemember that even the smallest actions have impact, just as a giant tree \\ngrows from a small seed. Even in the most stressful of times, we can take \\nsmall actions to live by our values and maintain or create a more satisfying \\nand fulfilling life. These values should also include self-compassion and care. \\nBy caring for oneself, we ultimately have more energy and motivation to then \\nhelp others.\\n29 \\nBeing Kind \\n“Being Kind” is a fourth tool for reducing stress. Kindness can make a \\nsignificant difference to our mental health by being kind to others, as well as \\nto ourselves. \\nMaking Room \\n“Making Room” is a fifth tool for reducing stress. Sometimes trying to push \\naway painful thoughts and feelings does not work very well. In these \\nsituations, it is helpful to notice and name the feeling, and then “make room” \\nfor it. “Making room” means allowing the painful feeling or thought to come \\nand go like the weather. Nurses can educate clients that as they breathe, they \\nshould imagine their breath flowing into and around their pain and making \\nroom for it.

Coping strategies are classified as adaptive or \\nmaladaptive.  Adaptive coping strategies include problem-focused coping \\nand emotion-focused coping. Problem-focused coping typically focuses on \\nseeking treatment such as counseling or cognitive behavioral therapy. \\nEmotion-focused coping includes strategies such as mindfulness, \\nmeditation, and yoga; using humor and jokes; seeking spiritual or religious \\npursuits; engaging in physical activity or breathing exercises; and seeking \\nsocial support. \\nMaladaptive coping responses include avoidance of the stressful condition, \\nwithdrawal from a stressful environment, disengagement from stressful \\nrelationships, and misuse of drugs and/or alcohol.\\n2\\n Nurses can educate \\nindividuals and their family members about adaptive, emotion-focused \\ncoping strategies and make referrals to interprofessional team members for \\nproblem-focused coping and treatment options for individuals experiencing \\nmaladaptive coping responses to stress. \\nEmotion-Focused Coping Strategies \\nNurses can educate clients about many emotion-focused coping strategies, \\nsuch as meditating, practicing yoga, journaling, praying, spending time in \\nnature, nurturing supportive relationships, and practicing mindfulness. \\n1.

Many of us might draw on traditional images of someone anxiously \\nwringing their hands, pacing the halls, having a verbal outburst, or acting \\nerratically. Health care professionals should be aware that crisis can be \\nreflected in these types of behaviors, but it can also be demonstrated in \\nvarious verbal and nonverbal signs. There are many potential causes of crisis, \\nand there are four phases an individual progresses through to crisis. Nurses \\nand other health care professionals are often the frontline care providers \\nwhen an individual faces a crisis, so it is important to recognize signs of crisis, \\nknow what to assess, intervene appropriately, and evaluate crisis resolution. \\nDefinition of Crisis \\nA crisis can be broadly defined as the inability to cope or adapt to a stressor. \\nHistorically, the first examination of crisis and development of formal crisis \\nintervention models occurred among psychologists in the 1960s and 1970s. \\nAlthough definitions of crisis have evolved, there are central tenets related to \\nan individual’s stress management. \\nConsider the historical context of crisis as first formally defined in the \\nliterature by Gerald Caplan. Crisis was defined as a situation that produces \\npsychological disequilibrium in an individual and constitutes an important \\nproblem in which they can’t escape or solve with their customary problem-\\nsolving resources.\\n1\\n This definition emphasized the imbalance created by \\nsituation stressors. \\nAlbert Roberts updated the concept of crisis management in more recent \\nyears to include a reflection on the level of an individual’s dysfunction. He \\ndefined crisis as an acute disruption of psychological homeostasis in which \\none’s usual coping mechanisms fail with evidence of distress and functional \\n1. Caplan, G. (1964).

It is also \\nimportant to note that events may be managed differently by different \\nindividuals. For example, a stressful stimulus occurring for Patient A may not \\ninduce the same crisis response as it does for Patient B. Therefore, nurses \\nmust remain vigilant and carefully monitor each patient for signs of emerging \\ncrisis. \\nA crisis commonly occurs when individuals experience some sort of \\nsignificant life event. These events may be unanticipated, but that is not \\nalways the case. An example of anticipated life events that may cause a crisis \\ninclude the birth of a baby. For example, the birth (although expected) can \\nresult in a crisis for some individuals as they struggle to cope with and adapt \\nto this major life change. Predictable, routine schedules from before the child \\nwas born are often completely upended. Priorities shift to an unyielding focus \\non the needs of the new baby. Although many individuals welcome this \\nchange and cope effectively with the associated life changes, it can induce \\ncrises in those who are unprepared for such a change. \\nCrisis situations are more commonly associated with unexpected life events. \\nIndividuals who experience a newly diagnosed critical or life-altering illness \\nare at risk for experiencing a crisis. For example, a client experiencing a life-\\nthreatening myocardial infarction or receiving a new diagnosis of cancer may \\nexperience a crisis. Additionally, the crisis may be experienced by family and \\nloved ones of the patient as well. Nurses should be aware that crisis \\nintervention and the need for additional support may occur in these types of \\nsituations and often extend beyond the needs of the individual patient. \\n2.

Clouded consciousness refers to a state of reduced \\nawareness to stimuli. Delirium is an acute onset of an abnormal mental state, \\noften with fluctuating levels of consciousness, disorientation, irritability, and \\nhallucinations. Delirium is often associated with infection, metabolic \\ndisorders, or toxins in the central nervous system. Obtundation refers to a \\nmoderate reduction in the client’s level of awareness so that mild to moderate \\nstimuli do not awaken the client. When arousal does occur, the patient is slow \\nto respond. Stupor refers to unresponsiveness unless a vigorous stimulus is \\napplied, such as a sternal rub. The client quickly drifts back into a deep sleep-\\nlike state on cessation of the stimulation. Coma refers to unarousable \\nunresponsiveness, where vigorous noxious stimuli may not elicit reflex motor \\nresponses. For example, a client in a coma may not pull their foot away from a \\npainful prick of their toe with a needle. When documenting reduced levels of \\nconsciousness, note the type of stimulus required to arouse the patient and \\nthe degree to which the patient can respond when aroused.\\n6 \\nAppearance and General Behavior \\nThis component refers to an overall impression of the client, including their \\nphysical appearance regarding their age, grooming, dressing, posture, eye \\ncontact, ability to socialize with others, and general behaviors.

Short-term \\nmemory is the most clinically pertinent, and the most important to be tested. \\nShort-term retention requires that the patient process and store information \\nso that they can move on to a second intellectual task and then call up the \\nremembrance after completion of the second task.

For example, it can be difficult to \\nrepeatedly address a client’s negative state.

In such cases, nurses should examine their \\nreactions to the client and be alert to feelings of distraction, boredom, or \\nfrustration.

They begin to show \\nclear preferences for certain elements of the environment, such as food, \\ntoys, and clothing. A toddler’s main task is to resolve the issue of \\nautonomy versus shame and doubt by working to establish \\nindependence. For example, we might observe a budding sense of \\nautonomy in a two-year-old child who wishes to choose their own clothes \\nand dress themselves. Although the outfits might not be appropriate for \\nthe situation, the input in basic decisions has an effect on the toddler’s \\nsense of independence. If denied the opportunity to act on their \\nenvironment, they may begin to doubt their abilities, which could lead to \\nlow self-esteem and feelings of shame.\\n57 \\n• Initiative vs. Guilt \\nAfter children reach the preschool stage (ages 3–6 years), they are \\ncapable of initiating activities and asserting control over their world \\nthrough social interactions and play.

Infants develop an understanding of \\nwhat they want and what they must do to have their needs met. They \\nbegin to understand language used by those around them to make \\nneeds met. \\n• Preoperational period. The second stage begins in the toddler years. This \\ncontinues through early school-age years. This is the time frame when \\nchildren learn to think in images and symbols. Play is an important part of \\ncognitive development during this period. \\n• Concrete Operations period. Older school-age children (age 7 years to 11 \\nyears) learn to think in terms of processes and can understand that there \\nis more than one perspective when discussing a concept. This stage is \\nconsidered a major turning point in the child’s cognitive development \\nbecause it marks the beginning of logical or operational thought. \\n• Formal Operations period.

Science tells us that some children develop resilience, the \\nability to overcome serious hardship or traumatic experiences, while others do \\nnot. One way to understand the development of resilience is to visualize a \\nseesaw. Protective experiences and coping skills on one side counterbalance \\nsignificant adversity on the other. Resilience is evident when a child’s health \\nand development tip toward positive outcomes – even when a heavy load of \\nfactors is stacked on the negative outcome side.\\n68 \\nThe most common factor for children who develop resilience is at least one \\nstable and committed relationship with a supportive parent, caregiver, or \\nother adult. These relationships provide the personalized responsiveness and \\nprotection that buffer children from developmental disruption. They also \\nbuild their ability to plan, monitor, and regulate behavior that enables \\nchildren to respond adaptively to adversity and thrive. This combination of \\nsupportive relationships, adaptive skill-building, and positive experiences is \\nthe foundation of resilience.\\n69 \\nThe capabilities that underlie resilience can be strengthened at any age. It is \\nnever too late to build resilience. Age-appropriate, health-promoting activities \\ncan significantly improve the chances that an individual will recover from \\nstress-inducing experiences. For example, regular physical exercise, stress \\nmanagement activities, and programs that actively promote self-regulation \\n67. Schofield, D. W. (2018, December 26). Cognitive deficits.

Intentional torts are wrongs that the defendant knew (or \\nshould have known) would be caused by their actions. Examples of \\nintentional torts include assault, battery, false imprisonment, slander, libel, \\nand breach of privacy or client confidentiality. Unintentional torts occur when \\nthe defendant’s actions or inactions were unreasonably unsafe. Unintentional \\ntorts can result from acts of commission (i.e., doing something a reasonable \\nnurse would not have done) or omission (i.e., failing to do something a \\nreasonable nurse would do). Examples of torts affecting nursing practice are \\ndiscussed in further detail in the following subsections.\\n4 \\nAssault and Battery \\nAssault and battery are intentional torts. Assault is defined as intentionally \\nputting another person in reasonable apprehension of an imminent harmful \\nor offensive contact. Battery is defined as intentional causation of harmful or \\noffensive contact with another person without that person’s consent. Physical \\nharm does not need to occur in order to be charged with assault or battery. \\nBattery convictions are typically misdemeanors but can be felonies if serious \\nbodily harm occurs.\\n5 \\nAn example related to assault and battery in health care is the patient’s right \\nto refuse treatment.

A restraint is a device, method, or process that is used for the \\nspecific purpose of restricting a patient’s freedom of movement without the \\npermission of the person. Restraints include mechanical devices such as a tie \\nwrist device, chemical restraints, or seclusion. The Joint Commission defines a \\nchemical restraint as a drug used to manage a patient’s behavior, restrict the \\npatient’s freedom of movement, or impair the patient’s ability to \\nappropriately interact with their surroundings that is not standard treatment \\nor dosage for the patient’s condition.\\n12\\n It is important to note that the \\ndefinition states the medication “is not standard treatment or dosage for the \\npatient’s condition.” For example, administering prescribed benzodiazepines \\nas standard treatment to manage the symptoms of a diagnosed mental \\nhealth disorder is not considered a chemical restraint, but administering \\nbenzodiazepines to limit a patient’s movement is considered a chemical \\nrestraint. \\nSeclusion is defined as the confinement of a patient in a locked room or an \\narea from which they cannot exit on their own. Seclusion should only be used \\nfor the management of violent or self-destructive behavior. Seclusion limits \\nfreedom of movement because, although the patient is not mechanically \\nrestrained, they cannot leave the area.\\n13,14 \\n12.

Low levels of GABA are \\nassociated with seizures, anxiety, mania, and impulse control. Pregabalin \\nis an anticonvulsant that mimics the effects of GABA and is used to treat \\ngeneralized anxiety disorder. \\n• Dopamine: Dopamine plays an essential role in several brain functions, \\nincluding learning, motor control, reward, emotion, and executive \\nfunctions. It is associated with several mental health disorders and is \\ntargeted by many psychotropic medications. For example, bupropion is \\nan antidepressant that inhibits dopamine reuptake, leading to increased \\ndopamine levels in the synapse and relieving the symptoms of \\ndepression. Conversely, chlorpromazine blocks dopamine receptors and is \\nused to treat psychosis, but this blockade can cause extrapyramidal side \\neffects (involuntary and uncontrolled muscle movements). \\n• Serotonin: Serotonin modulates multiple neuropsychological processes \\nsuch as mood, sleep, libido, and temperature regulation. Abnormal levels \\nof serotonin have been linked to many mental health disorders such as \\ndepression, bipolar disorder, and anxiety. Many psychotropic medications \\ntarget serotonin. For example, fluoxetine belongs to a class of \\nantidepressants called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). \\nSSRIs prevent the reuptake of serotonin at the synapse, making more of \\nthe chemical available in the brain and relieving depression. \\n• Norepinephrine and Epinephrine: Norepinephrine and epinephrine \\nstimulate alpha- and beta-receptors in the sympathetic nervous system. \\nTheir release exerts effects on a variety of body processes, including stress, \\nsleep, attention, and focus.

The hippocampus is smaller in \\nsome depressed people, and research suggests that ongoing exposure to the \\nstress hormone impairs the growth of nerve cells in this part of the brain.\\n4 \\nThe amygdala is also part of the limbic system and is a group of structures \\ndeep in the brain that are associated with emotions such as anger, pleasure, \\nsorrow, fear, and sexual arousal. The amygdala is activated when a person \\nexperiences or recalls emotionally charged memories, such as a frightening \\nsituation, and sends signals to the hypothalamus to stimulate the \\nsympathetic fight-or-flight response.

The stress response \\nstarts with a signal from the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus, pituitary \\ngland, and adrenal glands form the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) \\naxis, which governs a multitude of hormonal activities in the body and also \\nplays a role in depression.

Between 80% and \\n90% percent of people with depression eventually respond well to treatment. \\nAlmost all patients gain some relief from their symptoms with effective \\ntreatment. Before a diagnosis is made or treatment planned, a mental health \\ncare provider should conduct a thorough diagnostic evaluation, including an \\ninterview, mental status examination, psychosocial assessment, and a \\nphysical examination performed by a primary care provider. In some cases, a \\nblood test might be done to make sure the depression is not due to a medical \\ncondition like a thyroid problem or a vitamin deficiency. The evaluation also \\nexplores medical and family histories, cultural beliefs, and environmental \\nfactors as part of the psychosocial assessment with the goal of arriving at a \\ndiagnosis and planning a course of action. Treatments for depression include \\nmedications, psychotherapy, electroconvulsive therapy, transcranial magnetic \\nstimulation, and encouraging self-care and effective coping strategies. Nurses \\nshould keep patient-centered care and client preferences in mind when \\nimplementing a client’s treatment plan. For example, the client should be \\neducated about the possible adverse effects associated with antidepressant \\nmedication, and their ability to pay for and obtain transportation to \\ntreatments like psychotherapy should be considered.\\n1 \\nAntidepressant Medications \\nBrain chemistry may contribute to an individual’s depression and may factor \\ninto their treatment. Read more about the causes of depression in the \\n“Causes of Depression” section of this chapter. For this reason, providers may \\nprescribe antidepressants to help modify an individual’s brain chemistry. \\nAntidepressants are used to regulate and increase neurotransmitters in the \\nbrain to improve mood. There are several classes of antidepressants with \\ndifferent mechanisms of action and potential adverse side effects.

Dementia refers to a \\ngroup of symptoms that lead to a progressive, irreversible decline in mental \\nfunction severe enough to disrupt daily life caused by a group of conditions \\nincluding Alzheimer’s disease, vascular dementia, frontal-temporal dementia, \\nand Lewy body disease. Alzheimer’s disease is one of the most common \\nforms of dementia. Alzheimer’s disease causes impaired memory and the \\nability to learn, reason, make judgments, communicate, and carry out daily \\nactivities. An early symptom of Alzheimer’s disease can be subtle memory \\nloss and personality changes that differ from normal age-related memory \\nproblems. They seem to tire or become upset or anxious more easily. They do \\nnot cope well with change. For example, they can follow familiar routes, but \\ntraveling to a new place confuses them, and they can easily become lost. In \\nthe early stages of the illness, people with Alzheimer’s disease are particularly \\nsusceptible to depression.\\n4 \\nWhile changes in the brain that cause dementia are permanent and worsen \\nover time, thinking and memory problems can be aggravated by untreated \\ndepression.\\n5\\n Nurses should report new symptoms of depression in clients who \\nhave been diagnosed with dementia. \\n4.

A manic episode is a \\npersistently elevated or irritable mood with abnormally increased energy \\nlasting at least one week. The mood disturbance is severe and causes marked \\nimpairment in social or occupational function. Severe episodes often require \\nhospitalization to prevent harm to self or others. As the manic episode \\nintensifies, the individual may become psychotic with hallucinations, \\ndelusions, and disturbed thoughts. The episode is not caused by the \\nphysiological effects of a substance (such as drug abuse, prescribed \\nmedication, or other treatment) or by another medical condition.\\n1 \\nAccording to the DSM-5, three or more of the following symptoms are present \\nduring a manic episode\\n2\\n: \\n• Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity \\n• Decreased need for sleep (i.e., feels rested after only three hours of sleep) \\n• More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking \\n• Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing \\n• Distractibility (i.e., attention is too easily drawn to unimportant or \\nirrelevant stimuli) \\n• Increase in goal-directed activity (either socially, at work or school, or \\nsexually) or psychomotor agitation \\n• Excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for painful \\nconsequences (e.g., engaging in unrestrained buying sprees, sexual \\nindiscretions, or foolish business investments) \\nPeople experiencing a manic episode may become physically exhausted. \\nDepressive episodes associated with bipolar disorder can lead to suicide.

As a nurse working with individuals with diagnosed anxiety \\ndisorders, be aware of your self-reaction. It is not uncommon to have feelings \\nof frustration, especially if you feel as if the symptoms are a matter of choice \\nor under the client’s control. The client often acknowledges the fear is \\nunrealistic or exaggerated but continues to engage in avoidant behavior. \\nRecall that avoidant behavior is a symptom, and behavioral changes are \\naccomplished slowly with treatment.\\n1 \\nIt is also important to be aware that hospitalized patients may develop \\nanxiety in association with other medical conditions (i.e., chronic obstructive \\npulmonary disease [COPD], angina, or hyperthyroidism) or medical \\nprocedures. Anxiety is a nursing diagnosis, as well as a potential mental \\nhealth disorder. While implementing interventions that address medical \\nconditions, often the nurse must also implement interventions that address \\nassociated anxiety. \\nAssessment \\nWhen assessing clients with anxiety, assess for the symptoms associated with \\nthe “fight or flight” stress response including the following\\n2\\n: \\n• Restlessness \\n• Altered concentration, attention, or memory \\n• Diminished ability to learn or problem solve \\n• Hypervigilance \\n• Fear \\n• Irritability or nervousness \\n• Hand tremors \\n1.

It is unique to each individual and \\ninfluenced by their experiences, environment (surroundings and life \\nsituations), and inherited characteristics. Personality traits are characteristics, \\nwhether considered positive or negative, that make up one’s personality. \\nHealthy personality traits include characteristics such as the following: \\n• Demonstrating healthy personal boundaries \\n• Accepting responsibility for personal actions \\n• Communicating in a healthy and effective manner \\n• Obeying laws \\n• Showing mutual respect in relationships \\n• Being independent \\n• Displaying confidence \\n• Behaving in a non-impulsive manner \\nReview healthy personal boundaries in the “Foundational Mental Health \\nConcepts” chapter. An individual’s personality is considered unhealthy and \\nclassified as a disorder when it impacts their interpersonal relationships and \\nresults in impaired functioning in social, occupational, or other important \\nareas of their life.\\n1 \\nThe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) defines a \\npersonality disorder as an enduring pattern of inner experience and behavior \\nthat deviates significantly from the expectations of one’s culture. Its onset \\ncan be traced back to adolescence or early adulthood and is present in a \\nvariety of contexts.

Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness that \\naffects how a person thinks, feels, and behaves. It also affects the person’s \\nability to recognize their symptoms as problematic, referred to as a “lack of \\ninsight.” Continuous signs of the disturbance must be present for at least six \\nmonths in order for schizophrenia to be diagnosed, and potential medical \\nconditions that could be causing delirium must be ruled out.\\n1,2 \\nSchizophrenia is typically diagnosed in the late teen years to the early thirties \\nand tends to emerge earlier in males than females. A diagnosis of \\nschizophrenia often follows the first episode of psychosis when individuals \\nfirst display symptoms of schizophrenia.

Instead of scolding, yelling, or spanking, use \\neffective directions, time-outs, or removal of privileges as consequences \\nfor inappropriate behavior. \\n• Create positive opportunities. Children with ADHD may find certain \\nsituations stressful. Finding out and encouraging what your child does \\nwell, whether it’s school, sports, art, music, or play, can help create positive \\nexperiences. \\n• Provide a healthy lifestyle. Nutritious food, lots of physical activity, and \\nsufficient sleep are important for preventing ADHD symptoms from \\ngetting worse. \\n• Communicate regularly with teachers.

Review nursing care for clients with risk for suicide in the \\n“Application of the Nursing Process in Mental Health Care” chapter. \\nSeverely malnourished clients may require therapeutic enteral nutrition. Any \\nclient with negligible food intake for more than five days is at risk of \\ndeveloping a potentially fatal complication called refeeding syndrome. The \\nhallmark feature of refeeding syndrome is hypophosphatemia but may also \\ninvolve serious sodium and fluid imbalances; changes in glucose, protein, and \\nfat metabolism; thiamine deficiency; hypokalemia; and hypomagnesaemia. \\nTo avoid this syndrome, a thorough nutritional assessment must be \\nperformed followed by the slow reintroduction of nutrients and fluids \\naccording to evidence-based guidelines.\\n13 \\nAfter resolving acute symptoms, clients with anorexia begin a weight \\nrestoration program for incremental weight gain with a treatment goal set for \\n90% of ideal body weight. Specially trained dieticians assist in developing \\ndaily meal plans and caloric intake, and clients are generally weighed two or \\nthree times a week to gauge progress.\\n14 \\nNurses should be aware that clients with bulimia nervosa typically establish a \\ntherapeutic nurse-client relationship more quickly than clients with anorexia \\nnervosa. As previously discussed in this chapter, clients with anorexia nervosa \\noften do not view their condition as a disorder and value their obsessive-\\ncompulsive behaviors with eating as a way to feel safe and secure and avoid \\nnegative feelings. Conversely, clients with bulimia nervosa view their \\nbehaviors as problematic and desire help.\\n15 \\nOutpatient Care \\nOutpatient partial hospitalization is an option for clients who have been \\nmedically stabilized. In this setting, clients are in a clinical setting during the \\n13. Mehanna, H. M., Moledina, J., & Travis, J. (2008). Refeeding syndrome: What it is, and how to prevent and treat \\nit.

These effects \\naccount for the euphoric or intensely pleasurable feelings that people \\nexperience during their initial use of alcohol or other substances. These \\nfeelings motivate people to use those substances again and again, despite \\nthe risks for significant harm. As individuals continue to misuse alcohol or \\nother substances, progressive changes, called neuroadaptations, occur in the \\nstructure and function of the brain. These neuroadaptations drive the \\ntransition from controlled, occasional substance use to chronic misuse that \\ncan be difficult to control and can endure long after an individual stops using \\nthe substances. These changes can lead to the need for increased amounts of \\nsubstances to achieve the same effect, referred to as tolerance. They may \\nproduce continued, periodic craving for the substance that can lead to \\nrelapse. More than 60 percent of people treated for a substance use disorder \\nexperience relapse within the first year after they are discharged from \\ntreatment, and a person can remain at increased risk of relapse for many \\nyears.\\n2 \\nFor many people, initial substance use involves an element of impulsivity (i.e., \\nacting without foresight or regard for the consequences). For example, an \\nadolescent may impulsively take a first drink, smoke a cigarette, experiment \\nwith marijuana, or succumb to peer pressure and try a party drug like Ecstasy. \\nIf the experience is pleasurable, this feeling positively reinforces the substance \\n1.

Another \\nperson may take a substance to relieve negative feelings such as stress, \\nanxiety, or depression. In this case, the temporary relief the substance brings \\nfrom the negative feelings reinforces substance use, increasing the likelihood \\nthat the person will use again.\\n3 \\nMany other environmental and social stimuli can reinforce a behavior. For \\nexample, peer approval positively reinforces substance use for some people. \\nLikewise, if drinking or using drugs with others provides a feeling of relief \\nfrom social isolation, substance use is reinforced.\\n4 \\nEventually, in the absence of the substance, a person may experience \\nnegative emotions such as stress, anxiety, or depression or the individual may \\nfeel physically ill. This is called withdrawal, which often leads the person to use \\nthe substance again to relieve the withdrawal symptoms. As use becomes an \\ningrained behavior, impulsivity shifts to compulsivity, and the primary drivers \\nof repeated substance use shift from positive reinforcement (feeling pleasure) \\nto negative reinforcement (feeling relief) as the person seeks to stop the \\nnegative feelings and physical illness that accompany withdrawal. Eventually, \\nthe person begins taking the substance not to get “high,” but rather to \\nescape the “low” feelings from withdrawal.

Trauma survivors often feel powerless and trapped. \\nHealth care situations can trigger past experiences of lack of control or an \\ninability to escape. Using nonthreatening body positioning helps prevent \\nthe threat detection areas of the patient’s brain from taking over and \\nhelps patients stay regulated.

Additionally, it is important to think about where you \\nand the patient are positioned in the room in relation to the door or exit. \\nBoth nurse and patient should have access to the exit so that neither feels \\ntrapped. \\n• Provide Anticipatory Guidance: Verbalize what the patient can expect \\nduring a visit or procedure or what paperwork will cover. Knowing what to \\nexpect can reassure patients even if it is something that may cause \\ndiscomfort. Past trauma is often associated with unexpected and \\nunpredictable events. Knowing what to expect reduces the opportunity \\nfor surprises and activation of the SNS symptoms. It also helps patients \\nfeel more empowered in the care planning process. \\n• Ask Before Touching: For many trauma survivors, inappropriate or \\nunpleasant touch was part of a traumatic experience. Touch, even when \\nappropriate and necessary for providing care, can trigger a “fight, flight, or \\nfreeze” response and bring up difficult feelings or memories. This may \\nlead to the individual experiencing increased anxiety and activation of the \\nstress response, resulting in disruptive behaviors and possible \\ndissociation. Dissociation is a break in how a person’s mind handles \\ninformation, causing disconnection from their thoughts, feelings, \\nmemories, and surroundings. Nurses are often required to touch patients, \\nand sometimes this touch occurs in sensitive areas. Any touch can be \\ninterpreted as unwanted or threatening, so it is important to ask all clients \\npermission to touch them. Asking permission before you touch patients \\ngives them a choice and empowers them to have control over their body \\nand physical space. Be alert to nonverbal signs such as eye tearing, \\nflinching, shrinking away, or other body language indicating the person is \\nfeeling uncomfortable. If the client exhibits signs of discomfort when \\nbeing touched, additional nursing interventions can be implemented \\nsuch as a mindfulness or grounding practice. \\n• Protect Patient Privacy: Family members and other members of the \\nmedical team may be present when you care for a patient.

It is crucial that \\nnurses do not put the responsibility on the patient to ask others to leave. \\nIt is the nurse’s role to ask the patient (in private) whom they would like to \\nbe present during care and ask others to leave the room. \\n• Provide Clear and Consistent Messaging About Services and Roles: \\nTrust is built when patients experience care providers who are forthright \\nand honest. Dependability, reliability, and consistency are important \\nwhen working with trauma survivors because previous trauma was often \\nunexpected or unpredictable. Providing consistency from the nursing \\nteam regarding expectations and/or hospital rules can help patients feel \\nsecure and decrease opportunities for unmet expectations that might \\nlead to triggering disruptive behavior. \\n• Use Plain Language and Teach Back: Avoid medical jargon and use clear, \\nsimple language. When patients are feeling triggered (i.e., their “fight, \\nflight, or freeze” system is engaged), information processing and learning \\nparts of the brain do not function optimally, and it is hard to remember \\nnew information. When providing education, information, or instructions, \\nbreak information into small chunks and check for understanding. Offer \\nto write important details down so they can accurately recall the \\ninformation at a later time. Use clear language and “teach back” methods \\nthat empower patients with knowledge and understanding about their \\ncare. \\n• Practice Universal Precaution: Universal precaution means providing TIC \\nto all patients regardless of a trauma history. Although ACE screening \\nmay be part of routine care, it can also have potential negative effects on \\npatients. Unless a trauma-focused intervention is needed to amend the \\nimpact of trauma, many TIC experts propose universal precaution rather \\nthan direct screening. \\n888  |  15.3 Trauma-Informed Care'),\n",

It’s too much – too much noise, too many people touching me, it’s just too \\nmuch.” The nurse moved Dana out of the trauma bay, which was near the \\nambulance entryway, and into a room where the nurse was able to close the \\ndoor. The nurse also posted signage on the door asking all staff and visitors to \\ncontact the nurse before entering the room.

However, community health nurses may face unique \\nbarriers when providing care to individuals, families, and community \\nmembers. Three barriers are referred to as gaining entry, role negotiation, and \\nconfidentiality: \\n• Gaining Entry: Community health nurses may be considered “outsiders” \\nas representatives of the established health care system and may not \\nnecessarily be trusted by community members. It is vital for community \\nhealth nurses to build trust and supportive relationships. When working \\nwith individuals and families, nurses should assess specific community \\nissues affecting that individual’s health or their access to health care and \\nthen address those issues in their nursing care plan. Nurses can also \\ninvestigate if there are community resources available to refer the client \\nand/or their family members for additional services. See Figure 16.3\\n7\\n for an \\nimage of Red Cross volunteers working with caregivers of clients \\nreceiving palliative care. \\n• Role Negotiation and Confidentiality: Community health nurses must \\nseparate their roles as data collectors, health professionals, and neighbors. \\nThese roles can be difficult to differentiate when the nurse is assessing \\ncommunity health needs and providing nursing interventions for a \\npopulation of individuals within their own home community. These \\nindividuals may include family members, friends, neighbors, or peers. \\nTrust must be established and confidentiality assured according to legal \\nand ethical parameters of nursing practice. Nurses should also establish a \\nsense of partnership and encourage clients to participate in planning \\npreventative health strategies for themselves and their families. \\n7. “10716898813_74292ef548_k” by Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is licensed under CC BY 2.0 \\n938  |  16.2 Community Health Concepts'),\n",

Both communities have a high rate of cancer, but the public \\nhealth response would be very different. Another example related to mental \\nhealth is related to various situational factors affecting depression. A high rate \\nof depression in one community may be related to socioeconomic factors \\nsuch as low-paying jobs, lack of support systems, and poor access to basic \\nneeds like grocery stores, whereas in another community it may be related to \\nlack of community resources during frequent weather disasters. The public \\nhealth response would be different for these two communities. \\nNurses must also recognize and value cultural differences such as health \\nbeliefs, practices, and linguistic needs of diverse populations. They must take \\nsteps to identify subpopulations who are vulnerable to health disparities and \\nfurther investigate the causes and potential interventions for these \\ndisparities. For example, mental health disparities pose a significant threat to \\nvulnerable populations in our society, such as high rates of suicide among \\nLGBTQ+ youth, reduced access to prevention services among people living in \\nrural areas, and elevated rates of substance misuse among Native Americans. \\nThese disparities threaten the health and wellness of these populations.\\n9 \\nKey points to consider when assessing a community using a sociocultural \\nlens include the following: \\n1.
